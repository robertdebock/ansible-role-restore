restore
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-restore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-restore)

The purpose of this role is to restore objects to your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.restore
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared. Tests have been done on machines prepared by this playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for restore

# What directory are the objects to be restored saved?
restore_directory: backups

# The directory of objects which need to be placed on the managed node
# temporarily.
restore_remote_directory: /tmp

# A list of objects to restore.
# Each list item should have:
# - name to find the object locally.
#   type, either directory or mysql.
#   destination, a directory where to unpack the object.
#
# Nota bene; the [backup role](http://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/backup) can be used to create restorable objects. The objects created with this role include the parent directory, so the destination mentioned here ~misses~ the last part of the directory

restore_objects:
  - name: varspool
    type: directory
    destination: /var
#  - name: drupal
#    type: mysql
#    destination: drupal
```

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

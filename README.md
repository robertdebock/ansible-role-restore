restore
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-restore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-restore)

The purpose of this role is to restore objects to your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.restore

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```
---
# defaults file for restore

# What directory are the objects to be restored saved?
restore_directory: backups

# The directory of objects which need to be placed on the managed node
# temporarily.
restore_remote_directory: /tmp

# A list of objects to restore.
# Each list item should have:
# - name to find the object locally.
#   type, either directory or mysql.
#   destination, a directory where to unpack the object.
#
# Nota bene; the [backup role](http://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/backup) can be used to create restorable objects. The objects created with this role include the parent directory, so the destination mentioned here ~misses~ the last part of the directory

restore_objects:
  - name: varspool
    type: directory
    destination: /var
#  - name: drupal
#    type: mysql
#    destination: drupal

# To update all packages installed by this roles, set `restore_package_state` to `latest`.
restore_package_state: present

```
